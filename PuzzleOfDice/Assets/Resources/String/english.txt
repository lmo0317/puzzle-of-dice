3013=It is a plan view of the dice. There is a rule in place of dice number. \n It is a rule that you get seven and add a number of dice that are face to face. \n In the game screen, you can see with your own eyes only three numbers of dice. \n However, you can also find the number of places that are invisible to the naked eye through the rules of the plan view. \n As a result, you can check that the number facing the dice one really is a 6.
3014=The opposite of one dice number, there was a number 6 dice really. \n Opposite the dice number 2, there will be number 5 dice If so? \n You can check once. I will move in the direction of the arrow.
3015=Dice number 5 came up on the dice number 2 towards the floor. \n It is really easy. \n Handy tip of one here! \n If you add the number of dice across mutual, conditional total is 7. \n You can play a little more interesting if you use a formula like this.
