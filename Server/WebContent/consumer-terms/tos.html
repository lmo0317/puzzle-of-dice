Such rules, scoring rules, controlsand guidelines form part of these terms and you agree that you shall comply with them in respect of each individual Game which you choose to access and/or play.</br></br>
			2.2 You are responsible for the internet connection and/or mobile charges that you may incur for playing our Games. You should ask your mobile operator if you are unsure what these charges will be, before you play.</br></br>
			2.3 We have the right to withdraw or modify one or more of our Games (in whole or in part) without liability to you from time to time:</br>
			<ul>
				<li> for technical reasons (such as technical difficulties experienced by us or on the internet); </li>
				<li> to allow us to improve user experience; </li>
				<li> where we have legal reasons for doing so (including privacy or other legal objections to the content or conduct of our Games); </li>
				<li> because it no longer makes business sense for us to provide the relevant Game; or </li>

			<strong>3 Accounts</strong></br></br>
			3.1 You agree that you shall take all steps necessary to protect your log in details and keep them secret. You agree that you shall not give your log in details to anyone else or allow anyone else to use your log in details or account. In these terms, references to “log in details” or “account” include your log in details and account for any social network or platform that you may allow our Games to interact with.</br></br>
			3.2 If you fail to keep your login details secret, or if you share your login details or account with someone else (whether intentionally or unintentionally), you accept full responsibility for the consequences of this (including any unauthorized purchases) and agree to fully compensate us for any losses or harm that may result.</br></br>
			3.3 We will not be responsible to you for any loss that you suffer as a result of an unauthorised person accessing your account and playing our Games and we accept no responsibility for any losses or harm resulting from its unauthorised use, whether fraudulently or otherwise.</br></br>
			3.4 We reserve the right to delete your account if no activity is conducted by you in relation to the account for 180 or more days. In such event, you will no longer be able to access and/or use any Virtual Money and/or Virtual Goods (as defined below) associated with that account and no refund will be offered to you in relation to the same.</br></br>
			3.5 You understand that if you delete your account, or if we delete your account in accordance with these terms, you may lose access to any data previously associated with your account (including, without limitation, the level or score you have reached in our Games and any Virtual Money or Virtual Goods associated with your account).

			<p>
			<strong>4 Virtual Goods and Virtual Money</strong></br></br>
			4.1 Our Games may include virtual currencies such as coins, gold coins and points (“ Virtual Money”) or items or services for use with our Games (“ Virtual Goods”). You can buy Virtual Money from us for real money if you are at least 18 years old. If you are over 18 years old you may also be able to buy Virtual Goods for real money and/or other credits.

			4.3 You agree that all sales by us to you of Virtual Money and Virtual Goods are final and that we will not refund any transaction once it has been made. If you live in the European Union you have certain rights to withdraw from distance purchases. However, please note that when you purchase a licence to use Virtual Goods or Virtual Money from us, the performance of our services begins promptly once your purchase is complete and therefore your right of withdrawal is lost at this point.</br></br>
			4.4 We reserve the right to control, regulate, change or remove any Virtual Money or Virtual Goods without any liability to you.</br></br>
			4.5 Without limiting paragraph 3.5, if we suspend or terminate your account in accordance with paragraph 7 of these terms you will lose any Virtual Money and Virtual Goods that you may have and we will not compensate you for this loss or make any refund to you.
